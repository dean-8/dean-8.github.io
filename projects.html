    <h1>My projects</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first project! <br>
    I made this website from scratch with very limited knowledge on HTML and no experience whatsoever with CSS, I've taught myself the basics of these languages to produce the website here!</p>
    <h4>Below are my projects with screenshots of inputs/outputs as well as the code itself</h4>

      <main>
        <section>
          <p>The projects below are from a Job simulation activity i completed run by JP Morgan. <br> </p>
          <nav>
            <a href="task1_2.csv" download>csv file used in task 1 and 2<br></a>
          </nav>
          <nav>
            <a href="Graph.py" download>task 1 code<br></a>
          </nav>
          <h5>Task 1:</h5>
          <p>For the first task, I was given a small csv file (linked above) containing the price of natural gas at the end of each month from 2020-2024 <br><br>
          I had to plot that data onto a graph, interpolate the graph to figure out prices between dates (such as in the middle of the month) and the final objective was to extrapolate the data for an extra year <br><br>
          This first task was the hardest for me personally, and took about 5-6 hours of coding, as i had never used data such as a csv file when coding before<br><br>
          I persevered throughout as it was very difficult, but I was really enjoying the challenge which kept me motivated <br><br></p>   
          <nav>  
            <a href="task2.py" download>task 2 code<br></a>      
          </nav>
          <h5>Task 2:</h5> 
          <p>For my next task, i had to create funtions that take in inputs: <br><br>
             ~ Injection date of natural gas into a storage location<br>
             ~ Withdrawal date of that natural gas from the storage location<br>
             ~ Maximum amount able to be stored<br>
             ~ The amount you want to buy and store<br>
             ~ Cost of storage between Injection and Withdrawal date<br>
             ~ Cost of injection/ withdrawal<br><br>
            The hardest part of this task was finding the amount of months between the injection and withdrawal dates as they were inputted a strings so i had to find methods such as string slicing to compare months </p>

            <a href="task3.csv" download>csv file used in task 3<br></a>
          </nav>
          <h5>Task 3:</h5>
          <p>This task was completely different to the first two, <br><br>
          I was given a large csv file with 10,000 records with information of peoples incomes, outstanding debt, outstanding loan, fico score and other relevant information about each person<br><br>
          my task was to make a program to output the probability of a customer defaulting on their lones and return the expect money lost<br><br>
          I looked at a few factors such as fico score as well as working out the loan as a % of their income<br><br>
          By looking at my already existing data i found the probability od default if these numbers were inputted</p>
