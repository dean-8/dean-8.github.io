    <h1>My projects</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first project! <br>
    I made this website from scratch with very limited knowledge on HTML and no experience whatsoever with CSS, I've taught myself the basics of these languages to produce the website here!</p>
    <h4>Below are my projects with screenshots of the code in action as well as the code itself</h4>

      <p>The projects below are from a Job simulation activity i completed run by JP Morgan. <br> </p>

      <h6>Task 1:</h6>
      <p>For the first task, I was given a small csv file (linked above) containing the price of natural gas at the end of each month from 2020-2024 <br>
      I had to plot that data onto a graph, interpolate the graph to figure out prices between dates (such as in the middle of the month) and the final objective was to extrapolate the data for an extra year <br>
      This first task was the hardest for me personally, and took about 5-6 hours of coding, as i had never used data such as a csv file when coding before<br>
      I persevered throughout as it was very difficult, but I was really enjoying the challenge which kept me motivated </p>
