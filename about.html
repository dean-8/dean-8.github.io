      <h4>My Interests</h4>
      <p>I'm passionate about both computer science and maths, and I really enjoy problem solving. <br>
      I've been learning to code for the past few years by taking GCSE Computer science and also by creating this website which I've really enjoyed making as it has taught me new coding skills and languages. <br>
      Currently I know basics of Python and I'm learning the basics of HTML and CSS by creating this website <br>
      Technology has always fascinated me due to its rapid development and the recent growth of AI which I hope to learn more about in the future </p>
